# Final Project - Connect 4 Game


## Description

In this project we plan on implementing Connect 4 as a playable game via Java. We want to allow players(clients) to connect to the server to play the game.

## Deliverables

 1. A completed Connect 4 game
 
 2. Fully functional "player" clients, and a functioning server that hosts the game.
 
 3. Being able to replay the game without restarting the client.

## Features 
 
1. Fully functional Connect 4 game.

2. Allows for two players to join into the game via connecting to the server.

3. Allows the players to play again without closing and reopening the client.
